# openslides
The objective is to create a tool which can present a markdown as presentation. This markdown can be pulled from a github repository.

The main objective is to make it possible to author the slides for an educational course in the form of Markdown. This markdown can be made available on github.

Just like code, it would be possible to fork, improve and reuse the slides of various authors.

After working with course materials for over 3 years, we have been convinced that the presentations or slides help a lot in education. A presentation or bunch of slides saves a lot of time of trainers and improves the delivery drastically by providing readily. The problem with slides usually is time it takes to create and updation.

So, just like code, if the world starts sharing, contributing and merging the work of each other with proper credit, it would improve the learning globally.

The teachers in a small town will be able to teach with the slides provided by experts in the domain.

The sub objectives of bigger vision are:
* Create a tool which can present a markdown as full screen and is readable from 10 ft. It should possible to embed images, youtube and other content
* Create a browser based WYSIWYG publishing tool for slides that saves the slides in markdown format
* Convince the thought leaders and great professors to publish the slides in the form of markdown on github
* Create a tool that can convert a book into the outline of the slides to help the teachers get started with the slides

We want to make the  course slides for education open source. 

Though there are tools like Google Slides, SlideShare but none of these is doing a good job of sharing and providing due credits to owners in following way:

* If you took a copy of someone's slides there is no way to provide credits to the actual author without spoiling experience of your own users.
* It is not possible to merge the updates done by actual author to your. 
* It is not possible to contribute back your changes. 
* It is not possible to rate a particular slide in a neat matter.

This is something that can be easily accomplished if we move the slide's publishing to guthub and choose the markdown as format.
